# Fortune Cookies

Your task is to create a simple UI to view daily fortune cookies. It is broken down into four small items:

1. Replace FAKE_FORTUNES with real data
  1. I provided a function in `./api` to fetch a random fortune cookie message from a remote server.
2. Transform a `Fortune-item` div into separate React component: `FortuneItem`
  1. Create a new React component named FortuneItem and use it to render each fortune message inside Fortunes component.
3. Make `Renew` button functional
  1. When the user clicks this button, you should update the relevant fortune message with a newly fetched fortune message.
4. Make `Highlight` button functional
  1. When the user clicks this button, you should color the text of the fortune message with a random color.
